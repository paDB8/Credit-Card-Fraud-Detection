# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Let's begin with a classic one: classification with imbalanced dataset. 

As you may have heard around, this is a common situation in several tasks such as upselling (getting your customer to buy more of a product already purchased) or cross selling (getting your customer to buy new products related to the one already purchased). After all, if evert customer was willing to upsell there would be not need of a machine learning model :-P

Credit card fraud detection is a similar beast but it's usually way way more imbalanced. You can find the original problem posted on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?datasetId=310&sortBy=dateRun&tab=collaboration
